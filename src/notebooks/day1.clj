;; I'm trying something new this year. My goal is to reduce the stress
;; of advent of code by taking my time more on each problem and
;; suppressing my natural competitiveness.

;; I plan on documenting my appraoch here
;; using [Clerk](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk)

;; Clerk seems to come with many nifty visualization tools and is
;; extensible so learning how to use it may prove useful in the
;; future.
